 * Utility class for DTO mapping operations.
 * 
 * <p>This class provides helper methods for converting between DTOs and domain models.
 * Rail implementations should extend this class or create their own mappers following
 * similar patterns.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class ACHDtoMapper extends DtoMapper {
 *     
 *     public ACHPaymentRequest toACHRequest(InitiatePaymentRequest request) {
 *         return ACHPaymentRequest.builder()
 *             .amount(request.getAmount())
 *             .debtorAccount(request.getDebtorAccount())
 *             .creditorAccount(request.getCreditorAccount())
 *             .build();
 *     }
 *     
 *     public PaymentResponse fromACHResponse(ACHPaymentResponse response) {
 *         return PaymentResponse.builder()
 *             .paymentId(response.getTransactionId())
 *             .status(mapStatus(response.getStatus()))
 *             .build();
